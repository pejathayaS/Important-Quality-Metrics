1. **Security** - defines how well the system restricts the unauthorized access  

3. **Performance** â€“ shows the response of the system to performing certain actions for a certain period of time.

3. **Interoperability** is an attribute of the system or part of the system that is responsible for its operation and the transmission of data and its exchange with other external systems.

4. **Usability** most important because users can see directly how well this attribute of the system is worked out, how easy to use handle and understand the system.

5. **Reliability** is the quality of system being trustworthy or of performing consistently well.

6. **Availability** is part of reliability and is expressed as the ratio of the available system time to the total working time.

7. **Maintainability** it is a statistical measure of the time to restore the system to fully operational status, once it has experienced a fault or say mean time to repair

8. **Modifiability** refers to the cost of change and refers to the ease with which a software system can accommodate changes.

9. **Testability** shows how well the system allows performing tests, according to predefined criteria.

10. **Scalability** is the ability of the system to handle load increases without decreasing performance, or the possibility to rapidly increase the load.

11. **Reusability** is a chance of using a component or system in other components/systems with small or no change.

12. **Supportability** is the ability of the system to provide useful information for identifying and solving problems.
