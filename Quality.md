**Reliability** is an attribute of the system responsible for the ability to continue to operate under predefined conditions.

**Availability** is part of reliability and is expressed as the ratio of the available system time to the total working time.

**Security** is responsible for the ability of the system to reduce the likelihood of malicious or accidental actions as well as the possibility of theft or loss of information.

**Maintainability** is the ability of the system to support changes.

**Modifiability** determines how many common changes need to be made to the system to make changes to each individual item.

**Testability** shows how well the system allows performing tests, according to predefined criteria.

**Scalability** is the ability of the system to handle load increases without decreasing performance, or the possibility to rapidly increase the load.

**Reusability** is a chance of using a component or system in other components/systems with small or no change.

**Supportability** is the ability of the system to provide useful information for identifying and solving problems.
